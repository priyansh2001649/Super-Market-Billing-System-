Project Title: Supermarket Billing System

Project Overview: The Supermarket Billing System is a Python-based application designed to handle customer transactions efficiently. The system features a user-friendly interface for adding items to a shopping cart, calculating total costs, applying discounts based on the total purchase amount, and generating an itemized bill. It also incorporates a card payment discount as an incentive for digital transactions.

Project Requirements: Programming Language: Python Environment: Jupyter Notebook Libraries Used: None (Standard Python functionality) Functionality: Displays available supermarket items and their prices. Allows users to add items to a cart and specify quantities. Automatically calculates the subtotal, applicable discounts, and the final payable amount. Generates an itemized receipt. Accepts multiple payment methods (Cash/Card). Provides a 50 Rs discount for card payments. Handles multiple customer transactions. GitHub Link: Supermarket Billing System Notebook

Sample Input/Output Scenarios: To demonstrate the systemâ€™s functionality, several test cases have been included in the Jupyter Notebook:

Scenario 1: A customer purchases two items and pays in cash, with no discounts applied. Scenario 2: A customer purchases items worth Rs. 5,200, receives a 20% discount, and pays with a card to avail an additional Rs. 50 discount. Scenario 3: A customer attempts to add an unavailable item to the cart and corrects it by choosing an available item. Steps to Run the Code: Clone or download the repository from the provided GitHub link. Open the Jupyter Notebook in a Python-supported IDE or JupyterLab. Run the cells sequentially to execute the program. Test the program by entering the requested inputs in the console. Future Enhancements: Include barcode scanning for easier item selection. Integration with a database for dynamic product management. Advanced analytics features like sales trends and customer purchase history.
